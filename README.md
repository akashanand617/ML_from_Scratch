# 🧠 ML From Scratch

Welcome to **ML From Scratch** – a hands-on project to deeply understand core machine learning and deep learning models by implementing them without external ML libraries like `scikit-learn`, `TensorFlow`, or `PyTorch`.

> Built with 🧮 `numpy` and 🔍 mathematical intuition.

---

## 📚 Goals

- Implement classic ML models (Linear Regression, Decision Trees, etc.)
- Build neural networks from first principles (forward/backward pass)
- Understand optimizers, loss functions, and regularization
- Explore foundational models for **LLMs** and **Computer Vision**
- Visualize decision boundaries, training dynamics, and internal layers
